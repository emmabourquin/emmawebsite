      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        This is my very first website, and I am excited to share it with you!
        <br>
        <br>
        My name is Emma and I'm currently an MBA student at National Taiwan Normal University.
        I was born in Taiwan and raised in Hawaii, though have also lived in Florida, Shanghai, and British Columbia.
        I am a passionate learner who constantly looks for ways to challenge myself.
        Within the next five years, I hope to be working in a dynamic and innovative company that values creativity and diversity,
        specializing in works related to international business, cross-cultural collaboration, and trend analysis.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some activities I enjoy in my spare time is playing computer games with my friends, taking my dog out for a long walk,
        cafe hopping in search of a good iced caramel latte, and watching the sitcom Friends for the nth time.
        During the summer of 2025, I took upon self-learning the coding languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python,
        as well as expanding my vocabulary in French and writing my thesis report on "Third Culture Kids Adapting in a Global Workforce".
        <br>
        <br>
        I have most recently been managing a property in Hawaii to soon remodel for sale and preparing for my last (hopefully) semester of my MBA program.
